# JAVA TEST

Im currently 3 weeks without touching in anything programming related, so im realy need to get back on the rails. And im need to learn to use git right.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE APLICATION
This java test will be a simple aplication, just a state machine that responds to text input.

I want to create objects that will react to changes in other objects, such as position, state, etc. I probably wont do anything executable nor visual, just logic to test somethings. Im still thinking about using runnable tho.

## All tested and ready to go
10/19/21
Im  tested all git related code and system and its ready to start. Unfortunatly i couldnt configure my IDE with Git, but fortunatly i discovered that i work quite well with commands in Git Bash. Im almost feeling like a hacker using the prompt that much! But now its time to realy work and see if i truly understand how git work.

And remember, its just a study project to learn about git. This project isnt suposed to be a magnum opus, because the main focus is learning git.
